# Available Scripts

REST App comes with a root `package.json` file that contains commands you can run for all the 
packages &ndash; web, server, and mobile.

You can run the scripts from the root of your REST App project:

```bash
# project root, typically apollo-universal-starter-kit
yarn build
```

Alternatively, you can run all the scripts using NPM:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Global Scripts in `root/package.json`

**NOTE**: Most scripts in `restapp/package.json` run with [Lerna], a tool that enables us to 
simultaneously run the same scripts for all the packages &ndash; client, server, and mobile.

### `yarn build`

Compiles the production application to the `packages/server/build`, `packages/client/build`, and `packages/mobile/build` 
directories for the server, client, and mobile applications respectively.

### `yarn clean`

Removes the compiled production application files from the `packages/server/build`, `packages/client/build`, and 
`packages/mobile/build` folders.

### `yarn start`

Runs the REST App in production mode. The application will be open in your default 
browser. The application code is minified and optimized to ensure the best performance.

### `yarn watch`

Runs the app in development mode and watches the changes made to the code using hot code reload.

The `yarn watch` command has a few specific implementations.

#### `yarn watch-client`

Runs the client-side React application in development mode and watches the changes using hot code reload. 

This command is especially useful if you're developing a Scala back-end application or your custom back-end app and you 
don't need the Express application to run. Also note that the server-side rendering is _turned off_ if you run 
`yarn watch-client`.

#### `yarn watch:android`

Runs the Expo Android project _and_ the Express back-end application in development mode. The command disables 
building the project for the web (the React application) and iOS platforms.
 
#### `yarn watch:ios`

Runs the Expo iOS project _and_ the Express back-end application in development mode. The command disables building the 
project for the web (the React application) and Android platforms.

### `yarn cli`

Runs the REST App built-in command line interface (CLI). The CLI is currently used for scaffolding 
and deleting REST App modules. Consult the [CLI guide] for more information about `yarn cli`.

### `yarn seed`

Seeds the sample data to the SQLite database. You can use the `yarn seed --prod` command for production mode.

### `yarn migrate`

Migrates the sample database. The command updates the database according to the latest migrations.

### `yarn rollback`

Rolls back the sample database to the previous state. The command simply cancels the last migration created with 
`yarn migrate`.

### `yarn exp`

Runs the `exp` Expo command.

**NOTE**: REST App uses the `exp` command, not the [`expo`] command that was recently suggested 
for use by Expo SDK. Currently, Expo allows you to use both `exp` and `expo`, but **REST App supports only 
`exp`**! 

In the project, the command `yarn exp` is basically a wrapper around the `exp` command from the Expo SDK. `exp` in 
REST App is in fact run by the [Zen] library, which creates the React Native app builds using [webpack] and 
[Haul CLI] **instead** of the [Metro bundler].

The `yarn exp` command in the project supports only the following `exp` (Expo CLI) commands: 

* `build:android` or `ba`
* `build:ios` or `bi`
* `publish` or `p`

To learn more about these Expo commands, consult the official [Expo CLI documentation].

### `yarn exp-publish`

Runs the mobile app in development mode and watches your changes to the app code. Upon any changes made to the 
app, the bundle will be updated and reloaded thanks to hot code reload.                                                        

### `yarn jest`

Runs the tests for the mobile app using Jest, a Facebook utility for running unit tests for React Native apps.

### `yarn test`

Runs the unit tests with Mocha and the static code checking with TSLint and ESLint.

### `yarn tests`

Runs the unit tests with Mocha and waits until all the tests are executed. The test results will be shown in the 
console.

### `yarn tests:watch` 

Runs the unit tests with Mocha, waits until they're executed, and automatically watches the changes to the tests or 
application code. Once the changes are made, the tests will re-run (one or more tests will be executed again depending
on how many changes you've made).

### `yarn lint`

Runs the `eslint` and `tslint` scripts to perform checks for errors in `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files.

### `yarn eslint`

Runs the static code checks using [ESLint] for JavaScript (the `.js` and `.jsx` files) to find any errors made by 
developers. The errors are automatically fixed if possible.

### `yarn tslint`

Runs the static code checks using [TSLint] for TypeScript (the `.ts` and `.tsx` files) to find any errors made by 
developers. The errors are automatically fixed if possible.

### `yarn heroku-postbuild`

Runs various commands specific for Heroku for REST App client, server, and mobile packages.
Once you publish your application on Heroku, this command will run `yarn build` for the client, server, and mobile 
packages. For example, after you build the project for Heroku, this command will publish the mobile app: It'll run 
`exp publish`, then log in to Expo, compile the mobile builds and publish them on Expo.

### `yarn precommit`

Runs additional checks before the code is committed to Git. 

`yarn precommit` is a utility command that runs each time you commit your changes to Git. You don't need to run this 
command separately, although doing so won't create any issues.

`yarn precommit` runs the [lint-staged] utility to find any changes in `.js`, `.jsx`, and `.json` files and fix errors 
if any. If changes were made in TypeScript files, then TSLint will run to check the code updates. If linting issues in 
the files are fixed, the file is committed to Git. During the checks, the code is also forcibly formatted.

When formatting the code isn't possible, however, the changes won't be committed, and the issues (the files and the 
lines where issues were found) will be shown in the console.
